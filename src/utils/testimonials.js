    text: 'Johannes is a real teamplayer - we had a setup with one UX designer focusing more on the prototyping in Figma and Johannes being in an advisor role, giving invaluable feedback and always being very active in discussions. With his experience he could often anticipate dead ends and sense difficulties in the user journey before they arose. When discussing user personas and the flow through the different screens, Johannes’ structured style of working made sure we get all the important details right while keeping an eye on the bigger picture. He suggested multiple tools that made our discussions a lot clearer and more effective. On the personal level he is a very friendly and fun coworker, always punctual, raising discussion points in a very polite and productive way. I highly recommend working with Johannes to shape your product vision and user journeys!'
