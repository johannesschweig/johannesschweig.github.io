Modern eye trackers use a combination of the pupil position and an infrared reflection to infer the point of gaze. Corrective eyeglasses, however, pose a challenge for the eyetracking system. They alter the image of the eye, thus causing errors in the eyetracking signal. These errors are related to the refractive strength of the eyeglasses. In my thesis, I tried to build a classification model that takes eye tracking data as input in order to output the refractive strength of the current user. On the basis of this classification, an error correction is applied that corrects the eye tracking data dependening on the refractive strength.")],-1)),R=t(()=>e("h2",null,"Data collection",-1)),T=t(()=>e("p",null,"I collected data using a head model with artificial eyes and different pairs of eyeglasses on various positions of the screen.
