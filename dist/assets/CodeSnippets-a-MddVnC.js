For example, users might want to create a column with the mean of three other columns or cut the surname of a "name surname" formatted column. Previously, this was possible with a String Manipulation node for Strings, a Math Formula node for numerical data and a Rule Engine node for conditions.

The new node should make it easier for users to create more complex logic.',-1),k=e("h4",null,"Research",-1),I=e("p",null,"I analyzed the current UI and interaction of the already existing nodes and found out that they had several disadvantages:",-1),x=e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"They were making poor use of space.
