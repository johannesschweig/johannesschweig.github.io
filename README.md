# Portfolio website
My portfolio website using Vue.js, GridCSS and Tailwindcss, deployed on github pages. 

## Getting Started
Clone this repository. There are three branches:
- main: the vue source code of the latest version of the website
- gh-pages: the deployed files for github pages as a git subtree


### Prerequisites

You need `nodejs` and `npm`.

### Running the dev setup

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies, then `npm run dev` to start a development server on `localhost:5173`. Open your browser at `localhost:5173`.
